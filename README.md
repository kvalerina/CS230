The Gaming Room wanted to develop an online multiplayer game named "Draw It or Lose It," designed to run on various operating systems, expanding from an existing Android version. The game involves multiple teams competing to guess drawings in real time. Key requirements included support for multiple teams, unique game and team names, and ensuring that only one game instance runs in memory to maintain fairness and performance.

I was very successful in creating this documentation by clearly defining the functional needs and rules as well as the architecture of the system. I offered a thorough analysis of several platforms to help in the decision-making process for client-side and server-side technology. Detailed UML diagrams were also included to help stakeholders better understand the design elements by visually communicating the software's structure and relationships.

The development process was much more organized after going through a design document. It functioned as a roadmap to direct the coding process and guarantee that all team members understood the objectives as well as the constraints of the project. Also, the document helped to reduce uncertainty and potential errors during the coding phase by allowing discussions on design decisions and problem-solving techniques.

I would add more to the "System Architecture View" section of the document. In order to further explain how the system manages multiple users and real-time data coordination, I would include scenarios, data flow diagrams, and more thorough descriptions of the system's physical components. These changes would improve comprehension and perhaps identify areas that could be optimized prior to the start of production.

I determined the software's scalability and reliability by analyzing the demands of the user and concentrating on the game's need to accommodate numerous players and teams in a real-time setting. This was made possible by the choice of suitable design elements and technology that allowed quick data transfers and high scalability. The needs of the user must be taken into account in order to guarantee that the program meets the end users' expectations about usability, performance, and dependability and delivers the intended value.

I approached the software design process by thoroughly considering user needs, existing system constraints, and potential scalability. I used methods like making thorough UML diagrams, reviewing alternative design patterns, and taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of different platforms. To make sure the design stays in line with user needs and technical advancements, I would place a greater focus on continual improvement in the future, including frequent user feedback loops and prototype testing.
